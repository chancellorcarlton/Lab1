                There's good news and bad news for newcomers to the high-performance powerboat  and speed boat world. First, the bad. Nothing about go-fast boating is inexpensiveâ€”not the boats themselves, not the fuel for their engines, not the insurance and not, at least at the elite end of power and propulsion market, the maintenance. This is not an activity for the faint of wallet. No sense in sugarcoating it.

                Now the good news: High-performance powerboating is an adrenaline-fueled blast. To some degree, open water beyond the no-wake and slow-speed zones is the last frontier for those with a need for speed. From sight to sound, the sensation of speed on the water is like no others

                Far smaller than it once was, the core of the go-fast boat market has morphed
                into three currently popular categories: Performance-oriented V-bottom center
                consoles, sport catamarans and full-size go-fast catamarans and V-bottom
                sportboats. If you're at all confused about the difference between a catamaran
                and a V-bottom, look at it this way: A V-bottom has one hull. A catamaran has
                two. Simple, right? At this point, that's all you need to know. Now, let's take
                a look at each category.
